## Testing
Different applictions will require different accuracy, and the minimum accuracy is depending on your applications. 100% accuracy is generally hard to atain in machine learning. **Testing** your machine learning model is essential before being launch to know how the machine behave when it encounters new data that it has not seen before. From your dataset, you are likely to divide into __80% Training Data__ and __20% Testing Data__.

## Problems with Machine Learning
The machine learning learns by solely relying on the trainning data. Hence, a good machine learning model is trained by having a <em>good dataset</em>. This is important to avoid the machine learn some irrelevant details. Different features such as picture sizes, lightning, angle, etc counts. **Bias-sized** training data is also one of the common problem in machine learning. Researchers spend a lot of time on **testing** their model, by means of trial and error and focus on the misclassified class.

## Dangers of Machine Learning
Humans are worried that Machine Learning will become super-intellegent and takes over human. However, we are still far from that goals. A thing to note is that it will take over many human jobs and makes employment rate rise, and task will become relatively easy to complete. A quote 
> <em> "People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they're too stupic and have already taken over the world." </em>

In real world, data tends to be **biased**, making a **biased algorithm**. The important thing to note is the data representative. One of the machine learning challenges is the black box, the __Deep Neural Network__ that makes human not understand sometimes why is the predictions like that, hence difficult to trouble shoot.
