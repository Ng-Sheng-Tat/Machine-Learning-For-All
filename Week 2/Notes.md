## Bits
A **Bit** is the fundamental form of data, and it can only have two states which are 0 and 1 <em>(can be represented in other meaning)</em>. Eight big combining together will constitute a **Bytes**, a storage memory capacity. One bytes represents one characters. Real world deals with complex data, so modern combuter are using 32-bits or 64-bits underlying working mechanisms.

## Bytes and number
Recalling how the binary number format to convert to base-10 number format

## Others types of data
**ASCII Code** is the earliest encoding scheme for representing text for English. **Unicode** is devised later to merge other language, so that they can be comprehend by computer as well in bytes. For **picture**, it is represented as pixels. For white-black image, there is 0 to 255 characters to represents brightness. For color image, **RGB** color channel is used, plus one **alpha** representing opacity. For video, it is a series of pixel being frammed one after another. For **sound**, it can be converted to wave or voltages, and further broken down into numeric forms.

## Data Features
Take image recognition as example, the raw pixel levels is not a good way of representing data. The important aspect is __Freature Extration__. They can be classified into low-level and high-level. High level <em>(distinct)</em> is more preferable one. **Image Preprocessings** such as applying filter is important aspect to look at.

## Neural Networks
In Machine Learning, the feature is multiplied by a value called __weights__, which will be fined tunred by optimization functions. It will determine how important a value of the feature in representing the output. **Deep Neural Network** has <em>deep layers of neurons</em>, which makes the prediction is quite well. In fact, the mathematical behind machine learning is not fascinating, it is the too deep networks that makes everything seems very magic. They introduce a non-linearnity function at the end to customize into output. Nevertheless, the optimization functions and parameters is something challenging to be found. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is ultilizing a series of preprocessing techniques to process the data, and make well predictions and classifications on the <em>images</em>.
