## Artificial Intelligence

**Face Recognition** is easy for humans but very difficult for machine. In this course, we will be learning different techniques that can solve such problems of Artifical Intelligence (AI). Those Technique is knowns as **Machine Learning**.

## Machine Learning
Artificial Intelligence is working on to mimic human behaviour and tasks. This is quite difficult as humans do not know what is truely intellegence is.  __Turing Test__ is devised in such a way that passing this test will signify the born of true intellegence by using **NLP**. The famous applications of AI include **Computer Visions, Computing Creativity, Natural Language Processings, Robotics**. Nowadays, AI are narrow AI where there is only specific task that the particular AI is truely good at. The difficulty of inventing AI is due to that many rules that computer used is not explicitly clear and cannot be hard coded. The surrounding worlds are so complex that there is many hidden uncertainty.

## Machine Learning Algorithm
AI currently is worked based on simple **Statistical Model** as its underlying algorithm. It is provided with bunch of data to learn from those data. One of the most common algorithm is __Deep Learning__ which uses **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** It becomes so famous due to the increase in computing capability and data in recent years. A simple quotes > We do not have a better algorithm, we just have more data. 
The workflow of the Artificial Intelligence is summarized as follows:

The problems of AI can be broken down into **Supervised Learning (labelled data)**, **Unsupervised Learning (computer will discover the patterns)**, and **Reinforcement Learning (learn from mistake (punishment) and victory (rewards))**. There is several AI problems such as: 
1. <em> Classifications </em> -- output class/category
2. <em> Regresssions </em> -- output numbers/figures
3. <em> Generative Model </em> -- create output by itself

## Machine Learning Algorithm.2
There are many algorithm used in the world, they are simple and compiled mathematical functions <em>called mathematical model</em> but yet can do powerful jobs. One of the most common one used in this course is **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** in which the output is classified based on similarity. Another more light-weight and advance algoritm is known as **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. Other models include **Decision Tree Forecast**. __Optimization__ is a trial and error process to fine-tune the optimal parameter that gives the best accuracy and minimize the loss function to the biggest extend. s
